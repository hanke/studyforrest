Recent studies have demonstrated a close relationship between computational
acoustic features and neural brain activities, and have largely advanced our
understanding of auditory information processing in the human brain. Along this
line, we proposed a multidisciplinary study to examine whether power spectral
density (PSD) profiles can be decoded from brain activities during naturalistic
auditory experience.  The study was performed on a high resolution functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset acquired when participants freely
listened to the audio-description of the movie "Forrest Gump". Representative
PSD profiles existing in the audio-movie were identified by clustering the
audio samples according to their PSD descriptors. Support vector machine (SVM)
classifiers were trained to differentiate the representative PSD profiles using
corresponding fMRI brain activities. Based on PSD profile decoding, we explored
how the neural decodability correlated to power intensity and frequency
deviants. Our experimental results demonstrated that PSD profiles can be
reliably decoded from brain activities. We also suggested a sigmoidal
relationship between the neural decodability and power intensity deviants of
PSD profiles.  Our study in addition substantiates the feasibility and
advantage of naturalistic paradigm for studying neural encoding of complex
auditory information.


This study employed the high-resolution 7T fMRI from the audio movie
recording.
