Whilst external events trigger emotional responses, interoception (the
perception of internal physiological states) is fundamental to core emotional
experience. By combining high resolution functional neuroimaging with
concurrent physiological recordings, we investigated the neural mechanisms of
interoceptive integration during free listening to an emotionally salient audio
film. We found that cardiac activity, a key interoceptive signal, was robustly
synchronised across participants and centrally represented in the posterior
insula. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that the anterior insula,
specifically tuned to the emotionally salient moments of the audio stream,
serves as an integration hub of interoceptive processing: interoceptive states
represented in the posterior insula are integrated with exteroceptive
representations by the anterior insula to highlight these emotionally salient
moments. Our study for the first time demonstrates the insular hierarchy for
interoceptive processing during natural emotional experience. These findings
provide an ecologically-valid framework for elucidating the neural
underpinnings of emotional deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders.

This study employed the high-resolution 7T fMRI from the audio movie
recording in conjunction with the simultaneous physiological recordings.
