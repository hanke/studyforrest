Multi-subject fMRI data is critical for evaluating the generality and validity
of findings across subjects, and its effective utilization helps improve
analysis sensitivity. We develop a shared response model for aggregating
multi-subject fMRI data that accounts for different functional topographies
among anatomically aligned datasets. Our model demonstrates improved
sensitivity in identifying a shared response for a variety of datasets and
anatomical brain regions of interest. Furthermore, by removing the identified
shared response, it allows improved detection of group differences. The ability
to identify what is shared and what is not shared opens the model to a wide
range of multi-subject fMRI studies.

This study employed the high-resolution 7T fMRI from the audio movie recording.
